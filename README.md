# 🏓 PicklePong: Retro Rallies, Fresh Spin 🥒

Crank up the 8-bit tunes and dust off your tube socks—**Picklepong** is here to serve that groovy '70s arcade energy with a tangy twist.

Inspired by the legendary Pong, this game brings pixel-perfect paddle play into the now, blending the minimalist charm of the original with a juicy splash of pickleball chaos.

Whether you're reliving the glory days or discovering the magic of paddle battles for the first time, Picklepong’s neon-soaked nostalgia, chunky sound effects, and no-frills fun will have you hooked faster than you can say “Atari who?”

**🎮 One part pong, one part pickleball, all parts awesome.**
